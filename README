Name
    qqwry.lua - A Lua interface to famous IP <=> Location database qqwry.dat

Synopsis
    local qqwry = require("qqwry")

    local t = qqwry.query("8.8.8.8")
        -- t == {"美国", "加利福尼亚州山景市谷歌公司DNS服务器"}

    local v = qqwry.version()
        -- v == {"纯真网络", "2011年08月25日IP数据"}

Installation
    Put the qqwry.lua into any your Lua module search path

Note
    This implementation does not depend on any module other than standard Lua
    5.1 redistribution package provided, that means you can use it on the fly
    with a standard Lua 5.1 installation. 

    By using some third party modules, such as agentzh's lua-php-utils
    (https://github.com/agentzh/lua-php-utils), or LuaJIT's BitOp
    (http://bitop.luajit.org/), the performance of this module can be optimized
    much. Also, read qqwry.dat's data into memory entirely and avoid file 
    opeartions will give this program another pair of fatastic wings. :)
